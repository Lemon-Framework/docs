# Installation

Installation is provided via composer. Since Lemon is microframework you won't get any starting application.

```sh
$ composer require lemon_framework/lemon
```

Minimal version of php is 8.1.

Once you download lemon, create folder public and file public/index.php, this will be only visible file to the server. Why it's like this is discoused in other chapters.
