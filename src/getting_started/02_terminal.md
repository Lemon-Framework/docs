# Terminal

We have initialized our app, but how do we run it?

If we run our `public/index.php` in terminal: `php public/index.php` we will get command line interface for lemon. By default you will see help.

## Running our app

For running, there is command `php public/index.php serve` which starts php server.

More commands can be found in help.
