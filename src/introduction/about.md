# About Lemon

Lemon started as simple project for learning php. Main goal was to create simple to use framework with ability to create apps in one file. After 2 versions it has complex core but is still suitable for smaller apps.

## Features

- Simple to use router
- Safe, hackable template engine Juice
- Simplified database manipulation
- Debugging tools
- Html-based Terminal layer
- Http abstraction
- Simple key-value caching
- All bundled using DI container
